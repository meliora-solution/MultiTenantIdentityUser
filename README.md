## Authp multitenant UserManagement with Blazor 8

This project aims to establish a unified user identity for multitenant environments across multiple projects. The implementation relies on the AuthPermissions.AspNetCore library developed by John P Smith, available at https://github.com/JonPSmith/AuthPermissions.AspNetCore.

* One of the challenges I encountered while implementing the AuthP library is understanding and adapting MVC code to Blazor.
* Another significant hurdle is the absence of examples for creating multitenancy exclusively for the Identity User.
* English is not my native language, so please forgive any grammar errors or sentences that may not be entirely correct.
