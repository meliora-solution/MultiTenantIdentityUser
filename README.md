## Authp multitenant UserManagement with Blazor 8

This project aims to establish a unified user identity for multitenant environments across multiple projects. The implementation relies on the AuthPermissions.AspNetCore library developed by John P Smith, available at https://github.com/JonPSmith/AuthPermissions.AspNetCore. UserManagement, webApi and WebApp are custom implementation of the library.

To See Blazor version of the library see AuthpExample3 and AuthpExample6.  AuthpExample6 is not finished yet.  There are still some problems with my code.
