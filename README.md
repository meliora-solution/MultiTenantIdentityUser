## Authp multitenant UserManagement with Blazor 8

This project aims to establish a unified user identity for multitenant environments across multiple projects. The implementation relies on the AuthPermissions.AspNetCore library developed by John P Smith, available at https://github.com/JonPSmith/AuthPermissions.AspNetCore. UserManagement, webApi and WebApp are custom implementation of the library.

To See Blazor version example3 of the library see authpExample Folder.
